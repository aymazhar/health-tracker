# My eHealth Record

Summary

A common issue faced in healthcare today is the lack of a personalized electronic medical record
available to a person at anytime. Patients often forget their medication lists when going to the doctor or
research studies and are unaware of their previous vaccinations.

The proposed project functions as a personalized e-health tracker/medical record, with due dates, priorities and tags. The application will allow a user to create
a personal profile, where they can track their health measurements by inputting clinical values (height, weight,
heart rate, etc.) obtained from external devices (i.e. Fitbit). Users will also be able to log their vitamins, medications, and vaccinations, and be able to set due dates/reminders on when to take their medications next.

Description and Functionality

Users will be able to create a personal electronic record which will consist of the following subsections:
- Basic Information (full name, age, etc.)
- Clinical Values (height, weight, waist circumference, resting heart rate, blood pressure, etc.)
- Vaccinations (what they have gotten and when)
- Medications (what they are taking, how much, for how long and how often)
- Vitamins (what they are taking, how much, for how long, and how often)
- Health Conditions (diseases, allergies, etc)
- Reminders (for what, for when)
